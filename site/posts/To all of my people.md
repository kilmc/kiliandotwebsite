For the couches you let me sleep on  
For the crazy nice things you said about me  
For the conversations that lasted until the morning  
For the jokes that made me laugh ’til I was sore  
For the things you said that changed me for the better  
For the warm welcomes  
For the heartfelt goodbyes  
For the best hat ever  
For the help bringing my ideas to life  
For the hugs when we hadn’t seen each other  
For the belief in me when I had none in myself  
For the advice when it was asked for  
For the advice when it wasn’t  
For the kiss when I took a chance  
For the trust when it really mattered  
For the support when I broke down  
For the dose of reality  
For the best year to date

Thank you
