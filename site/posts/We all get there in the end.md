I get easily frustrated with myself when I can’t do something that, as I see it, everyone else can do. One of the most common sources of frustration is my difficulty with programming. I had a moment last week which I want to mark. I think it was important.

On Thursday I came across a really minor problem in Tito which involved IF/ELSE statements. Looking at the code I realised that with a slight tweak I could probably fix it. I made my changes, did some testing and was right. Problem solved!

This is so important because I tend to forget the struggles I’ve gone through learning new things. There was a time when looking at rails code was completely overwhelming. There was a time when looking at CSS or HTML was the same. So the fact that I understood enough to fix a bug means I must be getting better.

The frustration I feel is pointless. It’s simply me being impatient. I have proven to myself time and time again that I am incredibly capable. I just forget that on occasion.

So if you’re like me, and you beat yourself up for not being able to do something, consider what it took to get you to this point. You’ve overcome a lot, you’ll do it again.
