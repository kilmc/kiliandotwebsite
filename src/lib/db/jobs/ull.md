<!-- One of my first real design jobs, or real jobs of any kind, was designing the branding and marketing website for a burgeoning conference in Ireland called Úll. It was an Apple-inspired conference. I was introduced to Paul by a dear friend and after some brief chatting about what the ethos of the event I was tasked with coming up with an icon design and then the initial marketing site to have folks start to register for the conference.

Over three years I was given more and more creative freedom to design interesting things and by the end of my tenure there I was involved in everything from the Design of the site to the hiring of an illustrator to work on a new visual identity for the year to working with manufacturing companies to produce lanyards and everything in between.

I loved this job. I loved making things that felt like they were just for a specific person, that they were having a tailored experience. I was also given a lot of trust and freedom from Dermot, Paul and Sasha to make what I believed was going to be something delightful and fitting for the event each year. It was a great job for some wonderful people and I'm glad I got to take part in it. I still occasionally hear tech podcasters refer to the conference with fondness and it's nice to know I contributed something to that. -->
