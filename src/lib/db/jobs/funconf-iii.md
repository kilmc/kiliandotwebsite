- Designed and managed the production of a wooden badge, made of Irish oak and laser engraved with the attendee names, finished with a twisted white rope to nod to nautical themes of the event
- Worked with an illustrator to design a safety guide for attendees
- Designed and managed the production of a cloth map to help guide attendees around the island
- Procured flashlights, compasses, pencils and other items to help attendees navigate the island as well as tie in to the feeling adventure the organisers wanted to evoke
- Worked with local producers to manufacture a custom cloth bag (designed in partnership with my Mom) to carry all of the items for the attendee pack
- Designed a parcel of brown packing paper and twine to contain the attendee pack, a t-shirt, their badge and other materials for the conference to evoke a by-gone era

<!-- In September of 2012 Paul & Eamo, along with one-hundred or so eager and curious attendees set off on a train to _somewhere_ in the west of Ireland.

I had the privilege to design the attendee packs for the final Funconf. This event was going to be attended by a lot of Paul & Eamo’s close friends and so on top of this being the final, and most extravagant Funconf yet, it was also a very personal affair.

When we sat down a month or so before the conference and discussed what the packs should be I was full to the brim with ideas. The guys wanted wooden badges of some sort, they wanted attendees names to be typeset in an Irish style typeface and they wanted things like a torch and a map. Beyond that, they wanted this to be a keepsake.

I took all of this on board and got to designing. At some point I figured that with

- A notebook
- A pencil
- A torch
- A map
- A compass
- A wooden badge
- A stitched merit badge
- A t-shirt
- A pipe

That this pack should also have some kind of carry case so you could bring the stuff with you.

## The Badges

This was the central point of the pack for me. I had previously done the badges for Úll and they had been well received so Paul had asked me to give Funconf a similar treatment.

One of the aims of Funconf was to highlight and celebrate all of the wonderful things about Ireland and Irish culture. As an interesting little addition Paul had his uncle do his best at translating all of the names of the attendees into our native language Gaeilge.

I felt the need for a typeface that matched the Irish translations and so started researching the “Irish typefaces” as I knew them. As it turns out they are classed as Half Uncial and the one we are most familiar with—that is used in all sorts of pastiche, tacky and sometimes kinda racist designs—was actually created by an Austrian type designer called Viktor Hammer, who spent the best part of his life living in Texas.

In my research I ended up finding an absolute goldmine of information documented by a German type designer called Dan Reynolds. These two articles had so much history and information

**Typeface**

The typeface I ended choosing was Colmcille, designed by an Irish printer and typographer called Colm O’Lochlainn. Not only was I delighted that I could use a typeface by an Irish designer but he had a really wonderful connection to a bit of Irish history that was dear to me which was musician and song collector Seámus Ennis. Ennis is renowned in the traditional Irish music for the work he did collecting and preserving traditional Irish tunes and stories. As it turns out, O’Lochlainn gave Ennis his first job as a printer and Ennis also contributed to his books of Irish Street Ballads. According to Dan Reynolds article “The design’s intention was to provide a Gaelic looking type that worked well as a Roman text face”. This was precisely what I wanted. I needed something that would be easily legible but recognisably “Irish” in whatever sense people associate Half Unicials with Ireland.

**Badge/Wood**

Once I had chosen the typeface it was onto the actual badge itself. I decided to try and source some Irish wood. On the advice of a client I contacted Woodworkers in Teranure and visited their shop to look at samples. I was show birch ply at first but as soon as I felt it I realised how cheap it felt and asked to see some solid wood. I was then shown some Irish Oak. It was beautiful and with a very light oil applied to it, the grain was brought out in all of its glory. I was delighted.

**Lasering**

The next step was to finalise the design and talk to our laser guy about getting all of the names and designs lasered into the wood. I was a little worried that the oil coating might be

**Rope**

I knew that Funconf was going to be on Inishmór, an island off the west coast of Ireland, and for some reason decided that a nautical theme might be nice. I loved the idea of getting twisted rope to reflect the rope used on the docs. We found some soft cotten twisted rope which was going to be nice and comfortable for the attendees. -->
