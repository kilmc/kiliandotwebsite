Myself and my wife somewhat accidentally watched all 9 Fast and Furious movies in a week back in 2021. Toward the end of the run of films we thought it would be fun to make Bingo cards for the tropes within the movies and so Fast Bingo was born. It is currently just a website but we have plans to make physical, printed versions of them to potentially have friends over and play the game along with watching the films.
