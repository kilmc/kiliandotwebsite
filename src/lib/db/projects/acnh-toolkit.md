description: 'A fun little tool to help with catching all the critters in New Horizons.'

I built a little tool to help with catching all of the critters in Animal Crossing New Horizons. I built it mostly because I was finding it a little annoying to hop in and out of Critterpedia in the game and it was nice to have all of the info in one place. I really enjoyed working on this project, especially pulling inspiration for the colour palettes and iconography from the game. I was particularly proud of the hemisphere selection.

I don't actively maintain the project anymore but I am still proud of it and for a little while I think folks found it useful which made me happy.
