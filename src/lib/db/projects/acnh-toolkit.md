I built a little tool to help with catching all of the critters in Animal Crossing New Horizons. I built it mostly because I was finding it a little annoying to hop in and out of Critterpedia in the game and it was nice to have all of the info in one place. I really enjoyed this project and trying to pull inspiration for the colour palettes and iconography from the game but make them customised a little bit. I was particularly proud of the hemisphere selection.

I don't actively maintain the project anymore but I am still proud of it and for a little while I think folks found it useful which made me happy.
