Back in 2018 myself and my friend Nathan realised that we both adored the film Ocean's Eleven. At some point in our chatting about it we joked about doing a screening where we served people everything Brad Pitt ate or drank during the film. That joke turned into a full-fledged event with branding and gift bags, drinks and food, a quiz with prizes and a mystery for the small group of friends who we planned to invite.

We built out [a full site](https://susu.computer/snackalong/) that goes into much more detail which I fully recommend you read through.

It is without a doubt one of the most joyful things I've ever participated in making. We didn't do it for money—we didn't ask for anyone to pay—we also didn't do it for a bunch of strangers. We ran a silly event at a ridiculous level of detail and production just so we could give our friends a really fun experience. That remains one of my favourite things I've made and Nathan one of my favourite humans.

We still keep an eye out for another movie that we could do it with for a sequel to the event, but nothing has ever lit us up quite like Ocean's Eleven. We may never do another, but I think we're both ok with that.
