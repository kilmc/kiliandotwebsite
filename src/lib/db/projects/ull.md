One of my first real design jobs, or real jobs or any kind, was designing the branding and marketing website for a bureoning conference in Ireland called Úll which was an Apple-inspired conference. I was introduced to Paul and was tasked with coming up with an icon design and then the subsequent marketing site and other pieces to have folks start to register for the conference.

Over three years I was given more and more creative freedom to design interesting things and by the end of my tenure there I was more involved in everything from the Design of the site to the hiring of an illustrator to work on a new visual identity for the year to working with manufacturing companies to produce lanyards.

I loved this job. I loved making things that felt like they were just for a specific person, that they were having a tailored experience.
