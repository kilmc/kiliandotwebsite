I made this record over a few months after learning about [Ben Levin's 30 Second EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2dH-48tDMc) which was five six-second long tracks. It felt like such a great constraint that I wanted to try something similar. I landed on three tracks with the theme of RGB and the only real constraint I gave beyond that was that each track was faster than the previous one because each lightwave oscillates at a higher frequency than the previous one.
