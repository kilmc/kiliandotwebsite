I wrote this EP over several years in my late teens/early twenties and recorded it right before I moved to Brooklyn in 2014. I had been sitting on these songs for so long trying to perfect them. I realised that if I never recorded them I would never have anything to improve from, I would always keep tweaking these songs but never draw a line in the sand and say this is the best I can do now. I'm really glad I did because I look back on this record, definitely proud of making it, but knowing I can do a lot better than that.
