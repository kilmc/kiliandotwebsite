This is a project between my friend [John Farell](https://www.sofarjohn.com) and myself. We had been fans of each other as musicians for a long time during a birthday party at John's apartment we geeked out on the other and realised we should try and make something. This record was fun, and easy to make which I think is pretty rare. We tried recording a second one a year later which we never released but there was some gold in there. Now that I'm back living closer to Ireland we're probably going to go back into the studio and try to finally record a follow up to this weird little gem.
