I had a really moving realisation in therapy toward the end of last year. It was a normal session; talking about how unhappy I was at work. I've been pulling that thread for years and my therapist knows it well. But unlike previous sessions, at one point I said _I want to be a musician_.

Up until that moment I think I had always said _I play music_, or _I love music_. It's been with me my whole life. I learned traditional Irish instruments in primary school, I was in bands growing up, I taught people drums and guitar to make money in my teens. I've played live shows, released some stuff online. It's part of the fabric of who I am. But when I said _I want to be a musician_ I meant something specific. I didn't mean _I want to keep doing my hobby_. I meant _I want music to be my life and my work_. Saying that out loud made me burst into tears. To paraphrase Dune, when you have lived with hopelessness for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.

In the time leading up to saying those words, really for several years before that, I had felt something in me was gone. The part of me that had hopes, that was excited to make things or really engage in the world beyond purely surviving in it. I thought it was something I had grown out of. I couldn't see a future for myself. I didn't have any aspirations. I was just existing for the people I loved and who loved me. They were important and so I focused on them, but I was very lost. Sitting there in tears, on a call with my therapist, letting the impact of those words really sink in I felt something come back to me.

In the weeks after that session I thought about whether I really should do it. It felt surreal. I had been thinking about leaving my job, not my profession. That felt reckless. But even with that feeling of recklessness all the counter arguments and reasons against it didn't seem to matter. I felt this deep sense of conviction that I was going to do it. I had said the words out loud and it had set me on a path.

There was a galvanising moment that came a few months later. I had committed to the decision to leave the job and I had just enough of a plan to move forward. My therapist asked how I was feeling about it all. At first I got this big wide smile on my face and I thought _I want to jump around_, _I want to dance_. That's how it felt, just unbridled joy. But as I went to say that out loud I heard a word in my head, as clear as day.

_Live_. _I want to live_.

As I write this I'm in the last days of my notice at work, just a week or so to go. I've had this image in my head trying to visualise what's next. I'm on the edge of a forest. It's been a landmark off in the distance for my whole life but now I'm walking toward it. I definitely feel fear as I get closer because I don't know what lives in there, but I haven't broken my stride since I started walking toward it. I'm excited for the first time in a long time and this sense of conviction is so deeply comforting that it quiets my fear.

It feels good to have hope again. Now it's time to do something with it.
