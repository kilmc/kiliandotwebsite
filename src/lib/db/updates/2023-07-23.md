I recently made the decision to pursue music as a career and leave tech. There's more detail about what lead to the decision in [this post](/posts/returning-to-hope). I'm incredibly excited about it; it's been a lifelong dream.

That being said, it's going to take a lot for me to start making a living wage from this work. I have a bunch of stuff I've worked on in the

[music](/music) section. If you enjoy anything I make and want to work together on a project or have any folks you think I would be a good fit to collaborate with please send me an [email](mailto:mail@kilian.website).
