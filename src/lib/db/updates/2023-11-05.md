Over the past few weeks I've been improving a little javascript library for music theory related things. It's called [music-fns](https://github.com/kilmc/music-fns). I'm really happy with where I've gotten it. The main things I'm using it for right now are:

- [Key Guesser](/tools/music/keys/guess): A little tool to help figure out what key a piece of music is in
- [Key Page](/tools/music/keys/b-flat-major): A page that lists a musical key's main information including notes, triad chords and links to relative and parallel modes
- [Chords](/tools/music/chords): A page to build chord names and download a midi file of that chord
- [Scales](/tools/music/scales): A page to look up scales by note name and major, melodic minor or harmonic minor modes.
